/*Exercise 9. Temperature sensor

9.a The arduino has a 10 bit adc, A0, which means the analog input A0 is converted
into a value between 0 to 1023. The formula is Voltage = ADC value * 5/1023. 

9.b The loop runs 4 times. It prints ascii values as 0 , 2 , 4 and 6 out in the serial monitor. 

9.c For Serial.print(65) it sends Format data as redable text to the serial monitor as 65. As
characters 6,5. Outputtet converts numbers to their ascii representations. For Serial.write(65) it
sends a single byte with the value 65.

Exercise 11. 

11a I2C is a two wire communicatoion SDA (serial data line) transmits data between devices. SCL (Serial Clock Line) synchronize the data transmission. We use it for the LCD display
in the exercise. 

11.b To safe some computational for example only update the lcd when the displayed data changes.
